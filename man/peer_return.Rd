\usage{
peer_return(org, roster, path, form_review = NULL, form_rating = NULL,
  double_blind = FALSE, prefix = "", suffix = "", message = NULL,
  branch = "master", overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{org}{Character. Name of GitHub Organization.}

\item{roster}{Character. Data frame or file path of roster file with author-reviewer assignments. Must contain a column \code{user} with GitHub user names of authors, a column \code{user_random} with randomized tokens for user names, and one or more \code{rev*} columns that specify review assignments as values of the vector \code{user_random}.}

\item{path}{Character. File name or vector of file names to be included.}

\item{form_review}{Character. File name of reviewer feedback form (must be .Rmd document). If \code{NULL}, no link to the form will be created in the issue filed for authors.}

\item{form_rating}{Character. File name of rating feedback form (must be .Rmd document). If \code{NULL}, no link to the form will be created in the issue filed for authors.}

\item{double_blind}{Logical. Specifies whether review is conducted double-blind (i.e. neither reviewer nor author can identify each other), or single-blind (i.e. authors remain anonymous but reviewer identities are revealed). If \code{double_blind = TRUE}, reviewer folders are identified by the anonymized user IDs in the roster's \code{user_random} column. If \code{double_blind = FALSE}, reviewer folders are identified by the original user names. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{prefix}{Character. Common repository name prefix.}

\item{suffix}{Character. Common repository name suffix.}

\item{message}{Character. Commit message, defaults to "Assigning review."}

\item{branch}{Character. Name of branch the file should be committed to, defaults to \code{master}.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Whether existing files in reviewers' repositories should be overwritten, defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
